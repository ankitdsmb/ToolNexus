# Platform Feel Audit

## Static Zones Found
- Tool pages had strong visual styling but weak behavior signaling between runtime and docs.
- Readme sections rendered as long flat blocks, creating low interaction affordance.
- Related tool cards looked informational rather than actionable.

## Interaction Dead Zones
- No pointer or focus feedback on readme cards.
- Docs and runtime competed equally for attention instead of clearly prioritizing runtime.
- Next-step guidance was buried inside related tools section only.

## Missing Feedback Signals
- Minimal hover/focus emphasis for workflow cards.
- No “active workspace” cue around runtime area.
- Lack of micro-behavior cues when users move from runtime to docs.

## Workflow Friction
- Cognitive load from always-expanded documentation sections.
- Users needed to parse full docs before finding practical next actions.
- Related tools lacked contextual rationale.
