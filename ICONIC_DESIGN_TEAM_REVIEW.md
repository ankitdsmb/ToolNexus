# Iconic Design Team Review (Simulated)

## Senior Designer review
- **Verdict**: Strong improvement in brand-ownable identity.
- **Notes**:
  - Signal Rail motif is subtle and coherent across hero/sections/cards.
  - Typography hierarchy in hero now has a clearer confidence anchor.
  - Tonal layering remains restrained; does not drift into marketing gloss.

## Product Owner review
- **Verdict**: Positive, low-risk enhancement.
- **Notes**:
  - No architecture/runtime behavior changes.
  - Better first-glance differentiation without sacrificing clarity.
  - Discovery and workflow content remains easy to scan.

## CTO review
- **Verdict**: Approved.
- **Notes**:
  - Change is mostly CSS + minor copy emphasis in hero heading.
  - Focus states improved for keyboard users and brand consistency.
  - No backend logic touched.

## Developer first-impression review
- **Verdict**: Feels more "platform-like" and less template-like.
- **Notes**:
  - Cards feel related as a system.
  - Section rhythm is less visually fatiguing.
  - The motif reads as engineering-oriented instead of decorative.
