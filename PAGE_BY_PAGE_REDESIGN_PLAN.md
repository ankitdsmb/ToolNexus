# Page-by-Page Redesign Plan

## Type A — Home Page
- Hero: move to premium gradient identity with immediate product confidence.
- Emotional anchor: "engineering velocity + trust" framed by proof badges.
- Contrast strategy: alternate section energy via layered backgrounds.
- Discovery storytelling: guide users from search to featured tools to workflows.
- Trust signals: uptime/latency/privacy surfaced with stronger visual framing.
- Scan path: eyebrow → headline → CTA → interactive card matrix.

## Type B — Static Pages (About, Contact, Disclaimer, Privacy)
- Convert headers into story-leading panels with clearer intent cues.
- Improve readability using section cards and consistent rhythm.
- Present trust/compliance context in digestible section blocks.

## Type C — Tool Index / Search
- Discovery psychology: present the page as a workflow command center.
- Affordance: stronger toolbar framing and denser card elevation cues.
- Card hierarchy: title + capability + status metadata with clearer action feel.
- Filter clarity: category chips and density controls remain persistent and legible.

## Type D — Tool Runtime Page
- Workspace clarity: visually prioritize runtime container over supporting docs.
- Action-first hierarchy: runtime hero framing and stronger panel contrast.
- Docs balance: maintain depth but keep documentation visually secondary.
