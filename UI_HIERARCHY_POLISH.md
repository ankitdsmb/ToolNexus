# UI Hierarchy Polish

## Audit Summary
- Hero hierarchy was solid but improved with tighter heading letter-spacing and improved subtitle line-height for faster first-scan comprehension.
- Section breathing room was increased with slightly larger home block spacing and responsive clamp-based surface padding.
- Tool runtime pages were rebalanced by widening the gap between runtime and docs columns and increasing docs padding.

## Changes Applied
1. Increased home section rhythm (`--home-block-gap`) and made section padding fluid to improve visual cadence.
2. Strengthened section-title dominance with subtle size/line-height/letter-spacing adjustments.
3. Added improved readability to runtime hero subtitle text and emphasized tool page H1 rhythm.
4. Increased tool shell layout spacing to create clearer left-to-right scan path.

## Expected Impact
- Faster understanding of page intent.
- More premium whitespace distribution without structural change.
- Better visual confidence in top-of-page hierarchy.
