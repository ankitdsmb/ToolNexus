# Manual Design Team Review (Simulated)

## 1) Senior Designer Review
- Positives: stronger hierarchy, better visual rhythm, higher premium polish.
- Concerns: ensure contrast remains compliant in low-brightness displays.
- Action fixes: validate contrast and keep text-muted tones above accessibility thresholds.

## 2) Product Owner Review
- Positives: improved discovery confidence and clearer launch intent.
- Concerns: static pages should continue to emphasize practical guidance.
- Action fixes: preserve actionable copy and quick links in each static section.

## 3) CTO Review
- Positives: runtime anchors preserved; redesign remains contract-safe.
- Concerns: avoid decorative complexity that could affect maintainability.
- Action fixes: centralize visual changes in dedicated stylesheet (`product-transform.css`).

## 4) End User First Impression Review
- Positives: homepage now feels modern, focused, and trustworthy.
- Concerns: first-time users may still need rapid "where to start" prompts.
- Action fixes: maintain workflow-first copy in tool catalog and homepage sections.
