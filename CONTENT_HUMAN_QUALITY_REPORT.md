# Content Human Quality Report (Phase B2)

## Validation checklist
- No robotic repetition pattern detected in newly added sections.
- No keyword stuffing pattern; headings are intent-based and varied.
- Each section adds intent value (workflow selection, trust, troubleshooting, reporting clarity).
- Paragraph length kept short (1–3 sentences for most prose blocks).
- Actionable tone preserved with concrete workflow steps and internal next actions.

## Notes
- Tone follows senior-engineer style (practical, direct, low-hype).
- Internal links are contextual and limited to workflow relevance.
