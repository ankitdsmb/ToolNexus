# Iconic Design Audit

## Visual uniqueness
- The pre-existing homepage relied on high-quality but common "dark glass + neutral card" patterns found across many B2B products.
- Section framing, cards, and hero all used similar elevation language, reducing distinction between moments.
- Accent usage was mostly local (buttons/badges), not systemic.

## Memorability
- No persistent visual cue connected hero, section shells, and cards.
- Cards were functional but not signature-led, so scrolling did not create a brand-specific rhythm.

## Emotional impact
- Confidence and clarity were strong, but emotional imprint was subdued.
- The interface felt trustworthy and efficient, yet still "interchangeable" with generic modern dev tool landing pages.

## Brand recognition level
- Recognition potential: moderate.
- Craft quality: high.
- Distinctive identity marker: low prior to this pass.

## Why it felt generic
1. Repetition of familiar dark surfaces without a unique structural motif.
2. Limited cross-component brand language.
3. Hover/focus states were polished but not ownable.
4. Section transitions lacked directional visual flow.
