# Interaction Intelligence Report

## Implemented
- Added actionable-card semantics (`data-actionable-card`) to examples, workflows, and related cards.
- Added keyboard-focus and hover emphasis states with subtle lift and border reinforcement.
- Added pointer-guidance state on runtime movement to keep cards feeling responsive.
- Added workspace header hint to orient first action sequence.

## UX Outcome
- Cards now communicate “clickability” and relevance.
- Focus/hover feedback improves discoverability without flashy animation.
- Runtime-to-doc transition feels intentional and guided.
