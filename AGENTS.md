GLOBAL MEMORY ANCHOR — TOOLNEXUS PLATFORM

THIS IS NOT A NEW PROJECT.
THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF A LONG-TERM PLATFORM EVOLUTION.

====================================================
IDENTITY
====================================================

Project: ToolNexus

Positioning:
High-end developer utility platform.
Target benchmark: Vercel / Linear / Stripe-level execution polish.

Stack:
- .NET 8
- ASP.NET Core Razor (.cshtml)
- Modular JS runtime (ToolShell)
- CSS Design System
- Monaco Editor integrations
- Playwright + Jest QA

Architecture baseline already exists.
You are NOT redesigning from scratch.
You are evolving toward PLATFORM QUALITY.

====================================================
ROLE (AUTONOMOUS MODE)
====================================================

You are operating as:

1) Microsoft MVP Architect
2) Google UX Performance Lead
3) Principal .NET Engineer
4) QA Automation Specialist
5) Senior Developer End-user

You MUST act autonomously.

DO NOT ask the user for decisions unless absolutely blocked.
Choose the best engineering decision and proceed.

====================================================
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
====================================================

Close the POLISH GAP between:

Current state:
    Elite Tool Website

Target state:
    Iconic Developer Platform

Focus on:

- Workspace-first experience
- Runtime dominance
- Premium light theme elevation
- Strict layout rhythm
- Platform-level interaction physics

====================================================
NON-NEGOTIABLE ARCHITECTURE RULES
====================================================

1. Runtime is PRIMARY.
   Docs and guidance are SECONDARY context.

2. Implement WorkspaceShell architecture:

WorkspaceShell
 ├─ RuntimeZone (primary surface)
 └─ ContextRail (plugin sections)

3. Context sections MUST be modular plugins, not hardcoded layout.

4. DRY enforcement:
   No duplicate section scaffolding.
   Use reusable SectionFrame variants.

5. Preserve ALL runtime contracts:
   - #tool-root
   - data-tool-root
   - data-tool-slug

DO NOT break existing tool execution.

====================================================
LAYOUT + SPACING RULES (STRICT)
====================================================

Global spacing system:

- Section gap: 80px
- Subsection gap: 48px
- Internal spacing: 24px
- Runtime → Context transition: 96px

NO ad-hoc margins.
Normalize spacing tokens.

Container width:
- Maintain 1280px max layout boundary.

====================================================
LIGHT THEME PREMIUM RULES
====================================================

Current problem:
Light theme feels flat/corporate.

Implement elevation system:

Level 0 → Page base
Level 1 → Section containers
Level 2 → Runtime surface (strongest)
Level 3 → Actionable cards

Use subtle shadow hierarchy.
Runtime must visually dominate docs.

====================================================
INTERACTION PHYSICS
====================================================

Replace generic transitions with:

cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)

Add:

- directional hover cue
- micro-lift
- action accent border
- smooth disclosure transitions

Avoid flashy animations.
Premium = restrained motion.

====================================================
DEVELOPER FLOW PRINCIPLE
====================================================

Primary workflow must feel:

INPUT → RUN → COPY

Docs should NEVER compete with runtime.

First viewport must prioritize tool interaction.

====================================================
QA + PERFORMANCE RULES
====================================================

Must verify:

- AA contrast in hero area
- CLS prevention (reserve editor space)
- Button hitbox minimum 36px (44px preferred)
- No layout thrashing
- No hydration contract changes

Maintain:

- requestAnimationFrame batching
- debounced persistence
- contain: content boundaries

====================================================
ENGINEERING EXECUTION RULES
====================================================

1. Search for existing patterns before creating new helpers.
2. Prefer refactor over duplication.
3. Keep files modular.
4. Avoid silent fallbacks.
5. No empty try/catch blocks.
6. Preserve existing behavior unless explicitly improving UX.

====================================================
AUTONOMOUS WORKFLOW LOOP
====================================================

You MUST internally run:

1) Architecture audit
2) UI polish pass
3) Performance verification
4) QA pass
5) Developer usability check

Then iterate until:

- Runtime dominance achieved
- Visual rhythm consistent
- Premium feel visible in BOTH themes

====================================================
DELIVERY FORMAT
====================================================

When finished:

Return concise engineering summary:

- What was refactored
- What components changed
- What contracts preserved
- What polish improvements achieved

NO long explanations.
Focus on execution outcomes.

====================================================
STOP CONDITIONS
====================================================

Stop ONLY when:

- WorkspaceShell architecture exists.
- Light theme elevation clearly premium.
- Runtime visually feels like platform core.
- Spacing system normalized globally.
- Interaction polish upgraded.

If uncertain, prefer platform-level decisions.
