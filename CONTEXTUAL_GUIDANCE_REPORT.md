# Contextual Guidance Report

## Guidance Layer Added
- Introduced a “Next best actions” block ahead of advanced docs.
- Surfaced top related tools as companion workflow actions.
- Added action microcopy (“Open companion workflow →”) to communicate intent.

## Behavior Principles
- Guidance stays passive and contextual.
- No modals, interruption, or forced prompts.
- Maintains developer flow by keeping runtime first and suggestions secondary.
