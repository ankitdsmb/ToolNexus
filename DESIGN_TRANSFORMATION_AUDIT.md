# Design Transformation Audit

## Key findings
- The interface is structurally clean but lacked emotional contrast between primary and secondary zones.
- Hero and catalog surfaces had low visual tension, making first-impression energy feel muted.
- Tool cards were informative but not strongly action-signaling in hover and depth.
- Static/legal pages were readable but not narrative-driven, reducing trust-building momentum.

## Why the UI felt flat
1. Similar surface treatments across major sections reduced hierarchy clarity.
2. Limited lighting/contrast rhythm weakened premium SaaS perception.
3. Runtime pages balanced docs and execution too evenly; action layer needed dominance.
4. Micro-interactions were present but understated in conversion-critical components.

## Transformation direction
- Introduce premium depth gradients, stronger section alternation, and elevated interaction states.
- Reinforce action-first pathways (explore tools, launch runtime, process input).
- Strengthen storytelling rhythm across static pages while preserving clarity and compliance language.
