# Micro Spacing & Typography Report

## Token-Level Tuning
- Reused existing spacing and typography token system; no new token taxonomy introduced.
- Increased select spacing constants in-place for improved consistency and rhythm.

## Micro Adjustments
- Home card description minimum height increased for alignment consistency.
- Section title line-height and tracking refined for premium typographic cadence.
- Tool shell docs padding increased and per-section top spacing added.
- Intro and supporting paragraph line-heights adjusted for better readability density.

## Outcome
- Cleaner rhythm across content-heavy and tool-heavy surfaces.
- Improved emotional feel through slightly airier spacing without layout redesign.
