# Tool UX Polish

## Conversion & Workflow Improvements
- Primary action prominence increased by enforcing a minimum width for primary toolbar CTA buttons.
- Runtime panel now has subtle elevation to communicate "active workspace" confidence.
- Documentation panel now uses section separators to improve progression cues from overview to support details.

## Clarity Enhancements
1. Tool action buttons now read as a stronger action group through typographic consistency (`font-weight: 600`).
2. Runtime vs documentation split is more legible via increased spacing and stronger containment.
3. Documentation sections are chunked with dividers to support sequential reading and reduce cognitive load.

## Runtime Safety
- No selector, runtime node, or JS logic modifications.
