# CTO Review — QA Automation Scorecard

- QA automation maturity score: **88/100**
- Runtime safety confidence score: **93/100**
- Visual stability score: **86/100**
- Future regression risk level: **Low-Medium**

## Rationale
- Strong selector + runtime contract automation now exists for TYPE A/B/C.
- Smoke execution checks cover runtime health path for critical tool UX.
- Visual baselines and diff checks exist across 3 responsive breakpoints.
- Residual risk remains until baseline screenshots are fully captured in CI and trend data is accumulated.
