# ToolNexus User Manual

## What ToolNexus Does
ToolNexus gives you many developer tools in one place (formatting, conversion, validation, analysis), with a consistent interface.

## Unified Tool UI
Each tool follows the same flow:
1. Enter or paste input.
2. Run action.
3. See output and suggestions.

## Execution Flow (Simple)
- You start a tool action.
- ToolNexus validates and runs it safely.
- Results are shown in the output panel.

## Suggestions
Some tools offer smart suggestions based on your input (for example, helping you choose the next useful tool/action).

## Running Tools
- Open a tool page.
- Paste input.
- Click run.
- Review output and any warnings.

## Interpreting Results
- **Success**: output is valid and ready to use.
- **Validation warning**: input may need correction.
- **Fallback warning**: the system used a safe backup path to protect your session.
