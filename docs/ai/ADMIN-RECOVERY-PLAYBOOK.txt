ToolNexus Admin Recovery Playbook

Purpose
- Provide consistent admin/operator procedures for restoring service health.

Recovery Workflow
1) Triage
   - Identify blast radius, affected tools, and recent deploy/config changes.
   - Check runtime health indicators and error signatures.
2) Stabilize
   - Disable or isolate failing tool routes if needed.
   - Apply safe-mode behavior to prevent cascading failures.
3) Diagnose
   - Validate lifecycle state (initialize/execute/teardown) for impacted components.
   - Inspect normalized input/output traces for malformed payload patterns.
4) Recover
   - Roll forward with verified fix or roll back to last known-good state.
   - Re-run smoke tests and high-risk regression checks.
5) Closeout
   - Document root cause, customer impact, timeline, and follow-up actions.
   - Update prompt docs and tests to prevent recurrence.

Admin Safeguards
- Never apply unreviewed hotfixes directly to production.
- Prefer reversible configuration changes before binary changes.
- Preserve audit logs and incident artifacts for postmortem.
