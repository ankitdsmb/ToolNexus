ToolNexus Runtime Stabilization Strategy

Stability Goals
- Ensure predictable runtime behavior under valid and invalid inputs.
- Prevent avoidable crashes by enforcing safe execution contracts.
- Keep lifecycle management explicit and testable.

Runtime Rules
- Enforce clear tool lifecycle rules: initialize, execute, teardown.
- Distinguish execution from mount/bootstrap concerns.
  - Mount/bootstrap configures dependencies and state.
  - Execution performs request-scoped work only.
- Perform safe input validation before business logic.
- No runtime throws from public runtime boundaries; convert failures to structured results.

Operational Controls
- Timeouts and cancellation handling must be explicit.
- Use idempotent setup/cleanup where feasible.
- Capture structured logs for lifecycle transitions and failures.
- Prefer graceful degradation over hard failure when non-critical components fail.

Testing Requirements
- Add tests for lifecycle transitions and invalid input cases.
- Validate behavior for partial dependency failures.
- Confirm public boundaries return structured errors instead of throwing.
