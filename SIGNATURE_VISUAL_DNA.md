# Signature Visual DNA

## Chosen motif: **Signal Rail**
A subtle engineered rail made of:
- a diagonal precision light-track,
- a baseline divider rhythm,
- and a small luminous node anchor.

## Intent
- Expresses developer-system thinking (flow, routing, execution paths).
- Minimal enough to remain quiet and premium.
- Memorable because it repeats in consistent structural positions.

## Application map
- **Hero**: motif overlays + node anchor reinforce top-level identity.
- **Sections** (`.home-surface`): each block inherits the rail and node treatment.
- **Cards**: top micro-rail and stronger hover depth link cards to the same system language.

## Supporting brand details
- Unified focus ring treatment using accent halo.
- Header divider rhythm for section intros.
- Badge tinting aligned with motif accent system.
