Fix CI Workflow Property Quote Issue Again

- Rewrote `.github/workflows/ci.yml` using correct YAML multi-line syntax (`\`) for the `dotnet test` command.
- Preserved quotes around the `/p:Include` property to ensure MSBuild receives the argument correctly without shell expansion.
- Verified that all tests continue to pass locally.
