# README SEO + Content Quality Review

## Findings
- Heading hierarchy remains clear with one `<h1>` and section `<h2>` blocks.
- FAQ content is rendered in accordion form with schema.org FAQ attributes for structured extraction.
- Tone is instructional and human-readable; no repetitive keyword stuffing patterns introduced.
- Internal linking in Related Tools supports crawl depth and user continuation paths.

## Notes
- Keep Q/A wording concise and intent-based.
- Continue grounding section titles in developer tasks (quick start, examples, use cases).
