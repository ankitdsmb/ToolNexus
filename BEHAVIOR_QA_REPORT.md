# Behavior QA Report

## Scenario Evaluation

### 1) First-time user
- Smart Context Panel now explains how to unlock pathway suggestions by running once.
- Friction reduced by showing immediate, actionable next-step guidance.

### 2) Returning user
- Existing session/recents/history preserved.
- Workflow intelligence complements recent/pinned behavior without replacing it.

### 3) Multi-tool workflow
- Related tools and pathway cards reduce cognitive cost of deciding next tool.
- Continue workflow action shortens chain transition latency.

### 4) Long session interaction
- Debounced + idle persistence reduces background storage churn.
- Pathways remain stable and compact to avoid overload.

## Friction / Overload / Clarity
- Friction points: lowered by direct pathway links.
- Cognitive overload: controlled by limiting suggestions to top 3.
- Next action clarity: reinforced through completion signal and explicit continue button.
