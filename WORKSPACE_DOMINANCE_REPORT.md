# Workspace Dominance Report

## Structural Priority
- Promoted runtime workspace to primary left column.
- Moved docs into a sticky secondary rail on desktop.
- Added active workspace label and hint above runtime container.

## Visibility Improvements
- Runtime panel gets subtle focus/hover elevation.
- Docs remain available but visually subordinate.
- Supports faster loop: input → run → inspect → refine.
